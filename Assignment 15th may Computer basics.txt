1. A computer is an electronic Programable device that is capable of receiving, storing, processing, and outputting data. It is a programmable machine that follows instructions to perform various tasks and calculations.

2. RAM stands for Random Access Memory. It is a type of computer memory that is used to temporarily store data that the computer is actively using. Unlike long-term storage devices such as hard drives or solid-state drives, RAM provides fast and temporary storage that is directly accessible by the computer's processor.

3. In a computer, data is stored in different types of storage devices. Here are the main types of storage commonly found in computers:
HDD , SDD , CD , DVD

4. The input device commonly used to type text and numbers on a computer system is the keyboard. Keyboards are designed with a set of keys that correspond to letters, numbers, symbols, and various control functions.

When you press a key on the keyboard, it sends an electrical signal to the computer, which translates it into a specific character or command. This allows you to input text, numbers, and other characters into documents, applications, and various interfaces on the computer.

5. The output devices in a computer system are used to display or present information processed by the computer. Here are some common output devices:

1. Monitor/Display: A computer monitor or display is the primary visual output device. It presents text, images, videos, and graphical user interfaces (GUIs) generated by the computer. Monitors come in various sizes and technologies, such as LCD (liquid crystal display) or LED (light-emitting diode), and offer different resolutions and color capabilities.

2. Printer: Printers produce hard copies of digital documents or images on paper. They come in different types, including inkjet printers, laser printers, and dot matrix printers. Printers are commonly used to generate physical copies of documents, photos, or graphics.

6. The input device that allows a user to move the cursor or pointer on the screen is typically a mouse or a touchpad.
Mouse
Touchpad
Trackball
Trackpoint
Touchscreen

7. The programming languages that are directly understood by the computer without the need for a translation program are called machine languages or machine code. Machine language is a low-level language that consists of binary instructions (0s and 1s) that can be executed directly by the computer's hardware.

8. Input devices are used to provide data or instructions to a computer system. They allow users to interact with the computer and input information. Here are some common input devices: KEYBOARD , MOUSE , TOUCHSCREEN , TRACKPAD ,GAMPAD , SCANNER ETC.
